# The Trading Oasis üåäüìà


Welcome to **The Trading Oasis**, a comprehensive trading and portfolio management app for investors and traders to explore market insights, track holdings, and log trades ‚Äî all in one polished, interactive platform.  

While optimized for laptop/desktop, the app is fully **responsive and compatible with tablets and smartphones**, providing a seamless experience across devices.  

This project was built from scratch on a **$0 budget**, so you may notice a slight cold start from frontend and backend deployed APIs, but everything else is ready to explore and enjoy. Don‚Äôt be shy ‚Äî click around, try the features, and see what the app can do!  

**Live App:** [thetradingoasis.vercel.app](https://thetradingoasis.vercel.app)

## Overview

The Trading Oasis is designed for **active traders and investors**, combining real-time market data, sentiment analysis, and trade journaling.  

Leveraging a **modern full-stack architecture**, the frontend uses **Next.js (React + Node.js), TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS** for a responsive, dynamic interface, while the backend employs **FastAPI (Python) with Supabase (PostgreSQL)** for reliable and scalable data management.  

This project serves as both a **working demo** and a **template** for developers interested in building full-stack financial apps.
